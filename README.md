# Random Walk Simulation

This is a **group exercise**, so you should be working in pairs of two students. 

## Group Exercise

1. One student of your group forks the code from [https://github.com/advanced-geoscripting-2021/random_walker.git](https://github.com/advanced-geoscripting-2021/random_walker.git)

2. Invite the other student as a collaborator to the forked repository. 

3. Adapt the code to fulfill the requirements (see below).

4. Code review: Each group reviews the code of another group. 

5. Improve your code based on the review you got. 


## Requirements 

### Minimum requirements: 

Extend the program so the following requirements are met:

1. The program should be able to simulate multiple random walkers. 
2. The program should be executable from the command line. 
3. The user should be able to specify the number of random walkers through a command line parameter. 
4. Document the dependencies and instructions of how to run the program in your README.md.

Apply the best practices in scientific computing to make the code more readable, maintainable, reusable and efficient. 


### Additional requirements: 

1. Create three different types of walkers, e.g. a "fast walker" which has a bigger step size. 
2. Add a "landscape" in which the random walkers are walking in which contains obstacles which the walkers cannot traverse (e.g. a lake)
3. Create another feature of your own.

Be creative here! :) 

## Code Review 

Review the code of another group: 

1. Does it work properly? Try to make it fail!
2. Are the best-practices implemented in the code?
3. Is the documentation clear?
4. Can you adapt the code easily? E.g. try to create a new type of random walker which moves two cells per iteration.
